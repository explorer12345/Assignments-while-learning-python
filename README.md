# Assignments-while-learning-python
These are the assignments (mostly based on data analysis and probability) which I'd done while learning python

Pareto distribution: 
In this jupyter notebook I've explored pareto distribution. One can see the changes in pareto distribution by varying various parameters using float sliders.
You will require Numpy, matplotlib, scipy and ipywidgets libraries to run the code.
