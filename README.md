# Assignments-while-learning-python
These are the assignments (mostly based on data analysis and probability) which I'd done while learning python

Pareto distribution: 
In this jupyter notebook I've explored pareto distribution. One can see the changes in pareto distribution by varying various parameters using float sliders.
You will require Numpy, matplotlib, scipy and ipywidgets libraries to run the code.

Exploring pandas:
In this jupyter notebook I've done a small data analysis on the sslc1 data file uploaded in this repo. I've used some pie-charts, bar plots, correlation coefficients to analyse the data. I've also found the theoretical Confidence interval for one subject('math') in the data by converting the given data to a normal distribution and then comparing it with the actual value obtained by sampling the data.
You will require numpy,matplotlib,ipywidgets and pandas libraries & extract the 'sslc1.csv' file in the required directory to run the code.

Sampling Stats:
In this jupyter notebook I've represented a bimodal distribution and showed that a certain statistic (which should have a T distribution theoretically) has a T distribution by sampling.
You will require numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipywidgets libraries to run the code.

Life Expectancy Data Analysis:
In this project I've analysed the 'Life expectancy' data file using various python libraries and some theoretical data analysis tools. This include representing and comparing various parameters using barplots, boxplots, scatter plots. I've also used simmple linear regression to predict the future life expectancy and compared it with the actual ones.
